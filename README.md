# Equipment Information and Merge as part of a Project (Data cleaning, extraction, manipulation)

A client asked for their store data to be extracted into a clean Table from a messy master file of a recent survey of equipement status (See attached file). The file contained multiple inconsistencies across all sheets due to human input error that had to be cleaned before consolidated. After getting extracting the Store Information, I went on and continued to clean, extract, and manipulate as per client's requirements.

This repo includes 2 python scripts I wrote to extract and manipulate Equipment Information in detail for each store. There are 29 relevant rows for each store with error-prone values due to manual inputs via excel.


## DATA EXTRACTION AND MANIPULATION

I wrote 2 Python scripts to do what was required using the following Python libraries

* os
* pandas
* regex


## DATA CLEANING

I then used Excel to clean the data and ensure that it is of high integrity to be used later in visualisation tools like Tableau.
